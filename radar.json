These can either be entirely digital assets or tokenized versions of real-world assets. NFTs have a digital signature that makes it impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for or equal to one another. NFTs are non-interchangeable and non-divisible</li>\r\n \t<li>NFTs are one of the key building blocks of a new, Blockchain-powered digital economy. Several projects are experimenting with NFTs for a variety of use cases, such as gaming, digital identity, licensing, certificates, gaming, and fine art</li>\r\n \t<li>Digital identity is also a sector that can benefit from the properties of NFTs. Storing identification and ownership data on the Blockchain would increase privacy and data integrity for many people around the world</li>\r\n \t<li>With non-fungible tokens, users can store proofs of identity on the Blockchain while keeping the identity information securely stored by themselves, impossible to be forged or stolen</li>\r\n \t<li>NFTs open illiquid markets and create new platforms for ownership and exchange across many assets, including art and music. In addition, NFTs may also find application in several other areas including digital identity and NFT-backed loans</li>\r\n \t<li>In the formative years of the NFT market, content creators and brands in consumer goods, retail, travel, and automotive industries took the early steps to launch digital collectibles. However, the increased valuation of these collectibles brought financial services players into the game</li>\r\n \t<li>Currently, the NFT market is maturing and in the near future, many things will evolve into NFTs.

Instead of printing money, the central bank issues electronic coins or accounts backed by the full faith and credit of the government. CBDCs are the liability of the central bank, which means the government must maintain reserves and deposits to back it up, rather than a private bank</li>\r\n \t<li>A CBDC could be an important instrument for central banks to continue to provide a safe means of payment in step with the wider digitalization of people\u2019s day-to-day lives</li>\r\n \t<li>Public trust in central banks is central to monetary and financial stability and the provision of the public good of a common unit of account and secure store of value. To maintain that trust and understand if a CBDC has value to a jurisdiction, a central bank should proceed cautiously, openly, and collaboratively</li>\r\n \t<li>The demands for digital money and a cashless society are accelerating. Central banks are under pressure to improve the efficiency of payment systems; several CBDC projects are already in a pilot environment ahead of their formal launch, and stablecoins are finding use cases in streamlining cross-border CBDC payments</li>\r\n \t<li>There are two types of CBDCs: Retail and Wholesale. Retail CBDCs are designed to be held and exchanged between individuals and businesses, whereas wholesale CBDCs are for financial institutions</li>\r\n \t<li>In May 2022, Capgemini collaborated with Swift to explore ways to interlink the multiple domestic-based Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) networks emerging worldwide with existing payment infrastructures for seamless cross-border payments</li>\r\n \t<li>Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) development and experimentation continue to gain momentum.

Capgemini partnered with digital finance consortium R3 to demonstrate CBDC use cases for the central bank, engaged the broader banking ecosystem in the region, and built pilots around wholesale CBDC use cases.

Cross-border - SWIFT and Capgemini achieved CBDC-to-CBDC transactions between distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks based on Quorum and Corda technologies, fiat-to-CBDC flows, and a real-time gross settlement system. Further, their experiment proved that they could link the blockchain networks for cross-border payments through a single gateway. Additionally, SWIFT\u2019s new transaction management capabilities could orchestrate all inter-network communication.
