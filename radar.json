It also aims to make the Internet more open and decentralized. In the current framework, users have to rely on network and cellular providers that surveil the information going through their systems\r\n\r\nWith the advent of distributed ledger technologies, that soon might change, and users could take back ownership of their data, Since middlemen are removed from the equation, user data will no longer be controlled by them. This reduces the risk of censorship by governments or corporations and cuts down the effectiveness of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the Internet has been a long journey and will surely continue towards further iterations. With the massive explosion of available data, websites, and applications have the ability to transition to a web that provides a considerably better experience to an increasing number of users around the world\r\n\r\nWeb3 is the next stage of the web evolution that would make the internet more intelligent or process information with near-human-like intelligence through the power of AI systems that could run smart programs to assist users. While there is no concrete definition for Decentralized Web or Web 3.0 yet, it is already set in motion by innovations in other technological fields\r\n\r\nIn Feb 2023, the Tezos Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit foundation supporting the Tezos blockchain teamed up with Google Cloud to allow customers of the cloud computing business to deploy Tezos nodes and build Web3 applications on the blockchain. This partnership will make it possible for companies and developers to host and deploy RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes for Web3 applications using the Tezos blockchain and Google Cloud infrastructure\r\n\r\nFor both consumers and institutional participants, Web3 will need to overcome continuing challenges, obstacles, and risks. Regulatory oversight, user experience, and the underlying technology will all need to further mature for mainstream adoption to occur.
